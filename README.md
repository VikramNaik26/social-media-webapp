# Social Media Web App - DBMS Project Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the repository of my college Database Management System (DBMS) project. This project is a Social Media Web App that leverages the combined power of SQL, React, and Node.js. It represents the culmination of my journey in understanding databases, building dynamic web interfaces, and creating a platform for social interaction.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main components:

1. **Database (SQL):**
   - The database component is responsible for storing and managing the data related to users, posts, comments, and other social interactions.
   - SQL scripts are used to define the database schema, create tables, and establish relationships between entities.

2. **Frontend (React):**
   - The frontend is developed using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
   - React components are used to structure and render different parts of the social media platform, ensuring a seamless user experience.

3. **Backend (Node.js):**
   - The backend is implemented using Node.js to handle server-side logic, interact with the database, and manage user authentication.
   - Express.js is used as the web application framework to streamline routing and middleware.

## Getting Started

To run the Social Media Web App locally, follow these steps:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Execute the SQL scripts in the `social.sql` file to create and initialize the database.

2. **Backend Setup:**
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Run the backend server using `npm start`.

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Move to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies using `npm install`.
   - Start the React development server using `npm run dev`.

4. **Access the App:**
   - Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the Social Media Web App.

## Additional Information

Feel free to explore the project folders to gain insights into the code structure and implementation details:

- `database`: Contains SQL scripts for database creation and initialization.
- `server`: Implements the Node.js backend server using Express.js.
- `client`: Houses the React-based user interface for the social media platform.
